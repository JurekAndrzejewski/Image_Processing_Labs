# Image_Processing_Labs
7 laboratory sessions from Image Processing course on Lodz University of Technology.
Tasks vary from simple rotations and cutting parts of image to blurring with different filters, sharpening and corner detection. Whole course was finished with a project that detects movement in a live feed from multiple camera sources.
